# BLMProject
In order to determine if there are more bots on the conservative side vs the progressive side on twitter, I used an ec2 instance on AWS educate to write my code on an RStudio browser. I then used Twitter's API to return specific tweets and information regarding the tweets, such as the user, date created, etc. Using Terminal, I scheduled a cron job that returned 200 tweets every 30 minutes that mentioned "George Floyd" or "Black Lives Matter" or "BLM" as well as another 200 tweets every 30 minutes that mentioned "Trump2020" and "AllLivesMatter" using Twitter's API on R. After collecting the tweets and the users, I checked 5000 users on each side using the BotOrNot API which would return a probability for each user. The thresholds used for determining whether the user was a bot or not was >= .5 and >= .9. After perfoming a sensitivity analysis using both values, results varied significantly and >= .9 appears the most accurate.
I used Exploratory to easily filter the screennames in order to test the relevant screennames in the BotOrNot API.
